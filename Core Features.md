 1. Centralized Dashboard
- Core Feature: A unified interface displaying all connected social media accounts (e.g., Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, TikTok) with key metrics like shares, comments, mentions, and follower growth.
- Enhancement: Allow users to customize the dashboard layout (e.g., drag-and-drop widgets) to prioritize the metrics they care about most.
- Questionnaire Insight: Professionals want an all-in-one solution to reduce tool fragmentation (Page 4, Key Takeaway 1).

 2. Multi-Platform Integration
- Core Feature: Seamless integration with major platforms (Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn) to pull real-time data.
- Enhancement: Include emerging platforms like TikTok (noted on Page 4) and allow users to add custom APIs for niche platforms they monitor.
- Questionnaire Insight: Most users monitor 2-5 platforms (Page 2), and Instagram, Twitter/X, and LinkedIn dominate professional use (Page 1).

 3. Performance Metrics Tracking
- Core Feature: Collect and display metrics such as shares, comments, mentions, and follower growth for each account.
- Enhancement: Add comparative analytics (e.g., week-over-week or platform-vs-platform performance) and trend visualizations (charts/graphs).
- Questionnaire Insight: Users currently check analytics manually across platforms, indicating inefficiencies (Page 3).

 4. Sentiment Analysis with AI
- Core Feature: Use AI to analyze comments, mentions, and posts to determine positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- Enhancement: Provide sentiment trends over time and flag specific posts/comments driving sentiment shifts. Include keyword-based sentiment filtering (e.g., brand mentions).
- Questionnaire Insight: Inadequate sentiment analysis is a top pain point (Page 2), and AI-driven insights are highly valued (Page 1).

 5. Automated Reporting
- Core Feature: Generate performance and sentiment reports for accounts.
- Enhancement: Offer customizable report templates (daily, weekly, monthly) with export options (PDF, Excel). Include real-time report previews.
- Questionnaire Insight: Most users need daily or weekly reports (Page 2), and manual reporting inefficiencies frustrate them (Page 2).

 6. Flexible Viewing Options
- Core Feature: Display data in a unified timeline across platforms.
- Enhancement: Add a toggle for separate tabs per platform or a hybrid view (un18 option) to cater to varied preferences (Page 3).
- Questionnaire Insight: Users prefer unified timelines but also want flexibility (Page 3).

 7. Alerts and Automation
- Enhancement: Set up automated alerts for significant events (e.g., follower spikes, negative sentiment surges, or trending mentions).
- Questionnaire Insight: Automation is a top priority (Page 4, Key Takeaway 2).

 8. User-Friendly Onboarding
- Enhancement: Simplify account connection with OAuth logins and provide a guided setup wizard.
- Questionnaire Insight: Tool-switching fatigue is a major frustration (Page 3), so ease of use is key.
