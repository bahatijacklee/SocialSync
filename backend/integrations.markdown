# SocialSync Backend Integrations Plan

1. **Social Media APIs:**  
   - Twitter API v2  
   - Instagram Graph API  
   - LinkedIn Marketing API  
   - TikTok API  
   - Custom API adapters for niche platforms  

2. **AI/ML Services:**  
   - Hugging Face for sentiment analysis  
   - OpenAI API for advanced text analysis  
   - Custom ML models for platform-specific analysis  

3. **Background Processing:**  
   - Celery for task queue  
   - RabbitMQ for message broker  
   - Scheduled jobs for report generation  

4. **AI Assistant for MVP**  
   - Use a rule-based system with predefined responses (e.g., "best time to post" â†’ "Twitter: 8-10 AM").  
   - Store user queries in MongoDB for future AI training.  
   - Future Enhancement: Integrate Hugging Face or OpenAI for real-time sentiment and content suggestions.

5. **External Integrations**  
   - Use APIs to fetch live social media data (e.g., followers, engagement) once mock data is validated.  
   - Store generated reports in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3) for download via `/api/reports/:id`.
