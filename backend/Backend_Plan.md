 SocialSync Backend MVP Idea Plan

 1. Core Features for the MVP
The MVP should focus on delivering the essential functionality to validate the product with users. Based on the frontend, the key features are:
- User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and session management.
- Social Media Account Integration: Connect and fetch data from social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn).
- Analytics and Metrics: Provide basic analytics like follower count, engagement rate, and sentiment analysis.
- AI Assistant: Deliver simple AI-driven insights and recommendations (e.g., best time to post, content ideas).
- Reports: Generate and download performance reports.
- Profile Management: Allow users to manage their profile and connected accounts.

 2. Tech Stack
To keep the MVP simple and scalable, here’s a suggested tech stack:
- Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js (lightweight, widely used, and integrates well with Next.js).
- Database: MongoDB (NoSQL database, flexible for unstructured social media data, pairs well with Node.js via Mongoose).
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.
- Social Media APIs: Use APIs like Twitter API v2, Instagram Graph API, and LinkedIn API for data fetching.
- AI Integration: For the MVP, use a simple rule-based system for AI insights (e.g., predefined recommendations). Later, integrate an AI service like Google Cloud Natural Language for sentiment analysis.
- File Storage: Store generated reports in a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or Cloudinary.
- API Documentation: Use Swagger/OpenAPI to document endpoints for frontend integration.

 3. Backend Architecture
The backend should follow a RESTful API structure to communicate with the Next.js frontend. Here’s a high-level architecture:

- API Layer: REST endpoints to handle requests from the frontend (e.g., `/api/auth/login`, `/api/analytics/followers`).
- Service Layer: Business logic for processing data (e.g., calculating engagement rates, generating AI insights).
- Data Layer: MongoDB models for users, social media accounts, and analytics data.
- External Integrations: Connect to social media APIs and AI services.

 4. API Endpoints for the MVP
Here’s a list of essential API endpoints to support the frontend features:

 Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register`  
  - Registers a new user.  
  - Input: `{ email, password, firstName, lastName }`  
  - Output: `{ userId, token }`  
  - Stores user data in MongoDB (hashed password using `bcrypt`).

- `POST /api/auth/login`  
  - Authenticates a user.  
  - Input: `{ email, password }`  
  - Output: `{ userId, token }`  
  - Replaces hardcoded credentials (`test@example.com` / `test@123`) in `app/(landing)/login/page.tsx`.

- `GET /api/auth/me`  
  - Fetches the authenticated user’s profile.  
  - Output: `{ email, firstName, lastName, connectedAccounts }`  
  - Requires JWT token in the Authorization header.

 Social Media Account Integration
- `POST /api/accounts/connect`  
  - Connects a social media account via OAuth (e.g., Twitter, Instagram).  
  - Input: `{ platform, accessToken }`  
  - Output: `{ accountId, platform, username }`  
  - Stores the access token in MongoDB for future API calls.

- `GET /api/accounts`  
  - Lists connected accounts for the user.  
  - Output: `[{ platform, username, isConnected }]`  
  - Used in `app/(dashboard)/profile/page.tsx` for the "Connected Accounts" tab.

- `DELETE /api/accounts/:id`  
  - Disconnects a social media account.  
  - Input: Account ID in the URL.  
  - Output: `{ success: true }`

 Analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/overview`  
  - Fetches basic metrics (followers, engagement rate, impressions).  
  - Output: `{ totalFollowers, engagementRate, impressions }`  
  - Used in `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` for `DashboardOverview` and `app/analytics/page.tsx`.

- `GET /api/analytics/sentiment`  
  - Fetches sentiment analysis data for posts/comments.  
  - Output: `{ positive: 68, negative: 20, neutral: 12 }`  
  - For the MVP, use a mock sentiment score (e.g., 68% positive as shown in the dashboard image). Later, integrate Google Cloud Natural Language API.

- `GET /api/analytics/performance`  
  - Fetches performance data for charts (e.g., followers over time).  
  - Output: `[{ date, followers, engagement }]`  
  - Used in `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` for `PerformanceMetrics`. Populate the chart placeholder in `app/analytics/page.tsx`.

 AI Assistant
- `POST /api/ai-assistant`  
  - Processes user queries and returns AI-driven insights.  
  - Input: `{ query: "best time to post" }`  
  - Output: `{ response: "Twitter: 8-10 AM, Instagram: 11 AM-1 PM" }`  
  - For the MVP, use a rule-based system (similar to `app/ai-assistant/page.tsx`) with predefined responses. Store user queries in MongoDB for future AI training.

 Reports
- `POST /api/reports/generate`  
  - Generates a performance report PDF.  
  - Input: `{ timeRange: "30days" }`  
  - Output: `{ reportUrl }`  
  - Use a library like `pdfkit` to generate PDFs and store them in AWS S3. Used in `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` for `RecentActivity` (e.g., "Generated monthly report").

- `GET /api/reports/:id`  
  - Downloads a previously generated report.  
  - Output: Streams the PDF file.

 Profile Management
- `PUT /api/profile`  
  - Updates user profile information.  
  - Input: `{ fullName, email, phone, location, bio }`  
  - Output: `{ success: true }`  
  - Used in `app/(dashboard)/profile/page.tsx` for the "Edit Profile" feature.

 5. Database Schema (MongoDB)
Here’s a basic schema for MongoDB using Mongoose:

- Users Collection  
  ```javascript
  {
    email: String, // required, unique
    password: String, // hashed
    firstName: String,
    lastName: String,
    phone: String,
    location: String,
    bio: String,
    createdAt: Date,
    updatedAt: Date
  }
  ```

- Accounts Collection  
  ```javascript
  {
    userId: ObjectId, // reference to Users
    platform: String, // "Twitter", "Instagram", etc.
    username: String,
    accessToken: String, // encrypted
    connectedAt: Date
  }
  ```

- Analytics Collection  
  ```javascript
  {
    userId: ObjectId,
    platform: String,
    date: Date,
    followers: Number,
    engagementRate: Number,
    impressions: Number,
    sentiment: { positive: Number, negative: Number, neutral: Number }
  }
  ```

- Reports Collection  
  ```javascript
  {
    userId: ObjectId,
    timeRange: String, // "30days", "90days", etc.
    reportUrl: String, // S3 URL
    generatedAt: Date
  }
  ```

 6. Security Considerations
- Password Hashing: Use `bcrypt` to hash passwords before storing them in MongoDB.
- Access Tokens: Encrypt social media access tokens using a library like `crypto` before storing them.
- JWT: Use `jsonwebtoken` for authentication. Set an expiration time (e.g., 1 hour) and implement refresh tokens for longer sessions.
- Rate Limiting: Use `express-rate-limit` to prevent abuse of API endpoints.
- Environment Variables: Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database URI) in a `.env` file using `dotenv`.

 7. AI Assistant for MVP
For the MVP, the AI assistant can be a simple rule-based system (as in `app/ai-assistant/page.tsx`):
- Map user queries to predefined responses (e.g., "best time to post" → "Twitter: 8-10 AM").
- Store user queries in MongoDB to analyze common requests and improve the AI later.
- Future Enhancement: Integrate a real AI service (e.g., Google Cloud Natural Language for sentiment analysis, or a custom model for content suggestions).
